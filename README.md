   - Look at `days/day-1/` - this is your Day 1 lesson
   - Look at `exercises/day-1-basics.md` - this is your step-by-step guide
   - Notice `src/` is empty - you'll copy files here to work on them
   - See `days/day-2/` and `days/day-3/` for upcoming lessons

### Minutes 10-20: Your First MCP Tool
1. **Copy the starter file**:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item days/day-1/index-starter.ts src/index.ts
   ```
2. **Open** `exercises/day-1-basics.md` and follow Step 2B
3. **Build and test**:
