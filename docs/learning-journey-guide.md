## 💡 **Practical Example: How to Use Both**

### Scenario: Day 1 - Creating Your First Tool

1. **📝 Follow Exercise**: Open `exercises/day-1-basics.md`
   ```typescript
   // Exercise shows you HOW to create a greeting tool
   {
     name: 'greeting',
     description: 'Create personalized greetings',
     // ... step by step code
   }
   ```

2. **📖 Reference Best Practices**: Open `docs/best-practices.md`
   ```typescript
   // Best practices shows you WHY and professional patterns
   server.tool(
     "example-tool",
     "Example with proper error handling", // ← Professional naming
     { input: z.string() },               // ← Proper validation
     async ({ input }) => {
       try {                              // ← Error handling
         // Validate input
         if (!input || input.trim().length === 0) {
           throw new Error("Input cannot be empty");
         }
         // ... professional patterns
       } catch (error) {
         // ... proper error handling
       }
     }
   );
   ```

3. **🎯 Apply Learning**: Improve your exercise code
   ```typescript
   // Your enhanced greeting tool with best practices
   {
     name: 'greeting',
     description: 'Create personalized greetings',
     inputSchema: {
       type: 'object',
       properties: {
         name: {
           type: 'string',
           description: 'Name of the person to greet',
           minLength: 1  // ← Added validation from best practices
         }
         // ...
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## 🚀 **Quick Reference**

### **Need to DO something?** → Use Exercises
- "How do I create a tool?" → `exercises/day-1-basics.md`
- "How do I add validation?" → `exercises/day-2-tools.md`  
- "How do I create resources?" → `exercises/day-3-resources.md`

### **Need to UNDERSTAND something?** → Use Best Practices
- "Why use Zod validation?" → `docs/best-practices.md` → Input Validation
- "How to handle errors properly?" → `docs/best-practices.md` → Error Handling
- "What are security concerns?" → `docs/best-practices.md` → Security

### **Need to SEE a complete example?** → Use Examples
- "How does a real server look?" → `examples/weather-server.md`

## 📋 **Your Next Steps**

1. **Right Now**: Start with `exercises/day-1-basics.md`
2. **When You See 📖**: Open the corresponding section in `best-practices.md`
3. **After Each Day**: Review what you learned in both exercise and best practices
4. **For Real Projects**: Use `best-practices.md` as your professional guide

## 💭 **Think of It This Way**

- **Exercises** = Cooking lessons (step-by-step recipes)
- **Best Practices** = Culinary techniques (why recipes work, professional tips)
- **Examples** = Restaurant dishes (complete, real-world implementations)

You need all three to become a master chef! 👨‍🍳
